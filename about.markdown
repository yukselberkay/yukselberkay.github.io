Hi, I am Berkay. I am 24 years old. I love Cyber Security, CTF competitions, Software Engineering(especially low level stuff), [Music](https://soundcloud.com/berkayyuksel) and [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112457307-berkay-y-ksel). I may not remember a particular syntax or an algorithm while I'm trying to solve a problem, but I am quite good at searching for them. Everything I learned, I learned this way and I continue to do so.
